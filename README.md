# Cyberbullying Detection Reddit Bot Project
We are building a Reddit bot that pulls in new comments from Reddit and tries to detect any instances of cyberbullying using machine learning! This will all be built using Python :)

## Learning Objectives

- Get familiar with Python out-of-the-box. Most introductory programming classes will make you write code that only runs on your computer and doesn't really do anything useful. With this project our code will interact with the popular site Reddit. We focus on the practical application of Python.

- Have your first taste of machine learning. Artificial Intelligence is being used widely in the software industry today, let's learn a bit about how it works!

## Tools and Technologies

[Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/) as the language to power our project

[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning

[PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make the Reddit Bot
